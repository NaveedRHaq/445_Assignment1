            <h2>Common Themes in Media Studies</h2>
            <p>Through reviewing my peers' work, several common themes emerged:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Graduation Requirements: Many students, like those highlighted on <a href="https://ayndrs.github.io/445-Assignment-1/">this page</a>, take the class as a requirement.</li>
                <li>Evolution of Media: A significant interest exists in understanding how media has evolved, as seen on <a href="https://howard-wang-323.github.io">Howard's page</a>.</li>
                <li>Aspects of Good Media: Some students are keen to learn about what makes media effective, detailed by insights on <a href="https://628005910.github.io">this page</a>.</li>

            <h2>Revised Media Categorization</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on my peers' insights, I've decided to add a new category to my media hierarchy:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Social Media:</strong> This encompasses platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram, which play a crucial role in how we consume and interact with media today.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This addition enriches our understanding of media's scope and its impact on our daily lives.</p>
